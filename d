MARKET BY TYPE
Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a spore-forming bacterium that produces insecticidal crystal proteins known as delta-endotoxins. These toxins selectively target a wide range of insect pests, making Bt-based biopesticides a popular choice for integrated pest management programs. There are different types of Bt strains, each with specific target pests.

Bacillus thuringiensis Kurstaki (Btk) is the most widely used strain and is effective against lepidopteran pests such as caterpillars, moths, and butterflies. Bacillus thuringiensis Serotype Israelensis (Bti) is effective against mosquito and black fly larvae. Bacillus thuringiensis Aizawai (Bta) is effective against beetles and caterpillars, while Bacillus thuringiensis Tenebrionis (Btt) is effective against beetle larvae. Other types of Bt strains are also available, each with its specific target pests. These different types of Bt biopesticides provide farmers with a wide range of options for managing pest problems, leading to an increased demand for Bacillus thuringiensis in the market. Additionally, the high efficacy of Bt-based biopesticides in controlling insect pests and their low toxicity to non-target organisms have contributed to their increasing popularity in agricultural, forestry, and public health sectors.

MARKET BY APPLICATIONS
Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a biopesticide widely used in agriculture for controlling pests that damage fruit and vegetables, crops, and forests. It is an effective alternative to synthetic pesticides as it is environmentally friendly and does not harm beneficial organisms such as birds, bees, and other insects. Bt is also used in urban greening and gardening to control pests on plants and lawns. In addition, Bt is used in vector control programs to control mosquitoes that carry diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. Bt produces crystal proteins that are toxic to target insects, disrupting their digestive system and killing them.

The fastest-growing application segment of Bt in terms of revenue is the crop protection sector. The demand for Bt biopesticides is increasing as farmers are adopting sustainable farming practices and reducing the use of synthetic chemicals. In addition, the global biopesticide market is growing due to the increasing awareness of the harmful effects of chemical pesticides on human health and the environment. The use of Bt in fruit and vegetable production is also growing, driven by consumer demand for pesticide-free produce. Overall, the application of Bt is expanding as more industries recognize its potential as a safe and effective pest control solution.
